            <p class="speech">If the energy which you, in the course of your
                life, have spent in looking for money to pay interest had been used
                for something else, then, I believe, after all, you'd be able to turn
                everything upside down.</p>

            <p class="speech"> Nietzsche... a philosopher... a very great, a most celebrated
                man... a man of enormous brain, says in his books that you can forge
                bank-notes.</p>

        <h1>Tirumala Arikatla does Chekov tonight</h1>
        <h2>THE CHERRY ORCHARD Anton Chekov</h2>
        <p>PISCHIN. I'm full-blooded and have already had two strokes; it's hard
            for me to dance, but, as they say, if you're in Rome, you must do as
            Rome does. I've got the strength of a horse. My dead father, who liked
            a joke, peace to his bones, used to say, talking of our ancestors,
            that the ancient stock of the Simeonov-Pischins was descended from that
            identical horse that Caligula made a senator.... [Sits] But the trouble
            is, I've no money! A hungry dog only believes in meat. [Snores and wakes
            up again immediately] So I... only believe in money....
            
            TROFIMOV. Yes. There is something equine about your figure.
            
            PISCHIN. Well... a horse is a fine animal... you can sell a horse.
            
            [Billiard playing can be heard in the next room. VARYA appears under the
            arch.]
            
            TROFIMOV. [Teasing] Madame Lopakhin! Madame Lopakhin!
            
            VARYA. [Angry] Decayed gentleman!
            
            TROFIMOV. Yes, I am a decayed gentleman, and I'm proud of it!
            
            VARYA. [Bitterly] We've hired the musicians, but how are they to be
            paid? [Exit.]
